# SQL-PROGRAMMING  
## MySQL Practice Repository

This repository delivers a scalable, skills-focused SQL learning pipeline aligned to real-world database workloads. The content is divided into four progressive learning tiers and a dedicated project suite, enabling learners to ramp up from foundational syntax to production-grade querying capabilities.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Enable users to build operational fluency in MySQL through structured practice files, scenario-based queries, and hands-on database implementation tasks.

---

## 📘 Learning Levels

### **1. BASIC_INTRO**
Establishes core SQL fundamentals required for any data-stack role.  
Covers:
- Database creation and selection  
- Table creation with primary keys  
- Basic data types  
- Insert, update, delete operations  
- Introductory SELECT queries  
- Simple filtering and sorting  

This tier is designed to solidify foundational syntax and command-line familiarity.

---

### **2. BEGINNER LEVEL**
Builds capability for operational SQL workloads typically seen in entry-level developer and analyst tasks.  
Includes:
- Multi-table creation  
- Basic JOIN operations  
- Aggregate functions  
- WHERE + logical operators  
- ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING  
- Simple constraints and indexing  

Learners begin working with real data scenarios and multi-table logic.

---

### **3. INTERMEDIATE LEVEL**
Targets tactical problem-solving and workflow automation using SQL.  
Focus areas:
- Complex JOIN combinations  
- Subqueries (single-row, multi-row, correlated)  
- Views and stored routines  
- Advanced filtering constructs  
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, dense ranking use cases)  
- Transaction handling and ACID concepts  

This level prepares users for industry-standard querying challenges.

---

### **4. ADVANCED LEVEL**
Oriented toward high-performance SQL design and enterprise database operations.  
Covers:
- Query optimization strategies  
- Indexing patterns and execution plan analysis  
- Stored procedures and triggers  
- Error handling logic  
- Partitioning concepts  
- Advanced windowing and analytics-driven queries  

Users develop strategic control over data pipelines and performance tuning.

---

## 🛠️ PROJECTS
Provides mini end-to-end systems that consolidate learning into practical, production-style database implementations.

### **A. Student Management System**
Implements:
- Student information storage  
- Subject-wise marks  
- Data normalization  
- JOIN-driven report generation  
- Basic analytics using aggregates  

### **B. Inventory Management System**
Simulates:
- Product catalog creation  
- Stock, sales, and transaction tracking  
- Category-wise reporting  
- Aggregated insights using GROUP BY + HAVING  
- Realistic schema modeling  

Each project reinforces schema design, CRUD workflows, relational mapping, and reporting logic.

---

## 🏁 Outcome  
By completing all levels and projects, learners gain end-to-end ability to design, query, optimize, and manage relational databases using MySQL with operational confidence.
